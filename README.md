# InfiniteCopy Version 1.7.0 (Stable Release) ‚ôæÔ∏è
Infinite Copy is a Chrome Extension that allows you to copy anything you want and re-copy it again. These copied items include both text and images. To paste your current clipboard, press the paste button. To add your own text, press the plus button and input what you want to add, and then hit enter. To re-copy either text or image, just click on the container you want to copy. You can also use the context menus (when you right-click) and press 'Copy to InfiniteCopy'. Change the theme by clicking settings, then click one of the 5 different theme options that you want.
# What's New üÜï
1. New 'Quickstart Guide' when you install the extension
2. Support for MacOS cmd keys
3. Shifting to notifications instead of alerts on the background script
4. Base64 encoding for images now supported as an experimental feature
5. New 'Storage' tab with storage info in the Settings page
6. You now have the option whether to sync the storage or store it locally

# Work In Progress ‚öíÔ∏è
We are currently working on:
1. **Adding support for copying multiple formats (etc. plain text and images at the same time)**
2. **Adding CSS styling for when you open links with ctrl click**
3. **Publishing it to the Chrome Web Store! (Really excited for this one!)**

We would like to **thank** all of you guys for your support!
